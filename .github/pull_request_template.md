**What does this PR do?**
This pull request introduces a new --flat option to the CLI generator, allowing users to generate files directly in the root directory without creating additional subdirectories. The --flat option ensures that the files for controllers, models, routes, etc., are created in the specified directory rather than within separate folders (like /controllers, /models, etc.). Additionally, this PR ensures the proper generation of files for both MVC and non-MVC structures, along with support for various rendering engines (EJS, PUG, Handlebars) in MVC setups.
